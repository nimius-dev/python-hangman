# python-hangman
A basic command line hangman game written in Python with standard libraries.

This was originally designed by me whilst teaching middle schoolers how to program 
in Python. 
It has almost all the basic functionality you would except from a hangman game.

Future updates might add advanced error handling, quality of life improvements like
displaying which letters already have been guessed and a window based user interface 
with wx or tkinter.
